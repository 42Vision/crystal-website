## Github

The [`crystal` official code repository](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/) is on Github, so any bugs you find in either the language, compiler or standard library should be reported here - and pull requests are always welcome.

## Mailing list

The [crystal-lang Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/crystal-lang) is the first to-go place for any general discussion. Feel free to ask a question, share your project with others, ask for guidance and best practices, offer your help contributing to a project, or anything else Crystal-related.

## Blog

In the official [Crystal blog](https://crystal-lang.org/#blog) you can find the detailed announcements for new releases, some interesting use cases, or any other post from a member of our core team. We also accept posts from guest writers, so if you have something awesome you have built with Crystal, [contact us](. ";-)") and we'll be happy to have you featured on the blog.

## Gitter/IRC

The [crystal-lang/crystal Gitter room](https://gitter.im/crystal-lang/crystal) is the official chat room for Crystal. You can drop a quick question here to try and get it answered quickly, ask for guidance, or engage on a short discussion on a feature or project you are interested in. Make sure to keep the discussion organised, and consider using the mailing list if the chat drags for too long.

If you are more of an IRC kind of fellow, the [`#crystal-lang` channel at irc.freenode.net](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23crystal-lang), which keeps its logs in [irclog.crystal-lang.org](https://irclog.crystal-lang.org), is bridged to the Gitter room, so anything sent on one channel is forwarded to the other one.

## Twitter

The [@CrystalLanguage](https://twitter.com/CrystalLanguage) account will often tweet general announcements on releases and events, and retweet any interesting articles from the tweetosphere. Be sure to mention it if you are tweeting about Crystal!

## Reddit

The [Crystal Programming subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/crystal_programming/) contains announcements on new releases, interesting libraries, blog posts, and is in general a good place to share your work with the rest of the Crystal community.

## Stack Overflow

Of course, there is a [crystal-lang tag in StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/crystal-lang?sort=newest). Ask for help with your Crystal project there, or help other people solve theirs - learning & sharing all the way through.

## Awesome Crystal

Following the awesome-lists tradition, the [awesome-crystal](https://github.com/veelenga/awesome-crystal) Github repository contains a curated list of Crystal shards, tools and tutorials. If you want your contribution to Crystal to be listed here, fork the repository, add it to the list and send a pull request.

## Events

There are ongoing Crystal meetups on multiple cities around the globe, as well as online meetups, and Crystal presentations on programming conferences - there’s a good chance that you’ll find a Crystal talk at your nearest Rubyconf. Stay tuned for events near your location!
