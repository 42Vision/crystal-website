          <h3>What is this list?</h3>
          These are the companies and individuals contributing a monthly amount to help sustain Crystal's development. See the Bountysource campaign for more details.

        <p>
          <h3>I am a sponsor contributing $5/month, but my URL is not listed</h3>
          Bountysource does not yet have a UI for sponsors to provide their URL. Most URLs displayed in the list were obtained using the Github API and a heuristic to match the Bountysource slug (a sort of sponsor identifier) with the Github username, but this method was error prone and failed for many sponsors, including those that don't have a Github account.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are pledging $5/month or more and want to have your URL listed, please send a pull request to crystal.github.io with a new entry for your Bountysource slug in the js/sponsors-override.js file. If you don't have a Github account, you can write to the Crystal mailing list instead.
